# amazon-sales-data-analysis
Data analysis project focused on analyzing Amazon sales performance using real transaction data. The project explores sales trends, fulfillment methods (FBA vs Merchant), B2B vs B2C behavior, and order anomalies using Python and Pandas. 


This project analyzes real Amazon e-commerce sales data to evaluate sales performance,
order trends, and operational differences between fulfillment methods.

Key areas of analysis include:
- Time-based sales trends (daily and monthly)
- Fulfillment comparison (FBA vs Merchant)
- B2B vs B2C sales behavior
- Product-level performance analysis
- Detection of abnormal or unusual sales patterns

The analysis is implemented using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, with a focus on clean
